# New York metropolitan area

* [Russian & Turkish Baths (Boris week)](https://goo.gl/maps/U3oASP9XYd8baozW9)
Quintessential New York sauna. Purchase bulk passes for economic visits as low as $25. The brief era of the over-chlorinated cold plunge (~2019-2022) appears to finally be over and the Russian & Turkish Baths reigns as the best NYC sauna.
Sauna rating: 5/5
Cold rating: 4/5

* [Russian & Turkish Baths (David week)](https://goo.gl/maps/U3oASP9XYd8baozW9)
The penultimate New York sauna experience. Median patron age 1-2 years less than Boris week.
Sauna rating: 4.5/5
Cold rating: 4/5

* [Bathhouse](https://g.page/abathhouse?share)
True to overproductionized Williamsburg. Hilarious Aufguss experiences served daily represents the commoditization of wellness culture. Recommend avoiding if not for the reluctantly functional sauna and cold plunge.
Sauna rating: 4/5
Cold rating: 4.5/5

* [AIRE Ancient Baths New York](https://goo.gl/maps/9zkgKfBhgW626MY1A)
Like Williamsburg bathhouse, an overproductionized luxury experience but without the jarring dishonesty. It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. It therefore excels, and is worth visiting at least once. Two levels of cold plunge for the experts.
Sauna rating: 3/5
Cold rating: 5/5

* [SoJo Spa Club](https://g.page/sojo-spa-club-edgewater?share)
The Disneyland of NYC saunas.

* [King Spa & Sauna](https://g.page/koreanspa?share)
Spending a night in NYC? You don't need a hotel. Take the King Spa shuttle from Dunkin Donuts in midtown, spend the night at King Spa. Fairly standard Korean jimjilbang, and the best in the area.
